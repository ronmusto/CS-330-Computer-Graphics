# CS-330-Computer-Graphics

I approcahed designing this project based on the code I was given by my teacher and trying to build off that baseline. Since I had never coded anything like this before it was nice to have a simple model I could start with and then modify from there. I tried to think about wwhat kinds of difficulties I would run into while coding and that helped me to choose the desk layout for my design. I thought about how I would need to use basic shapes and only focused on objects that could be recreated in this low poly environment. 

I use what I would refer to as an iterative process to develop my programs. I usually will start off with just one piece of functionality and then from there I will slowly add to my project fixing errors along the way as I get closer to my final goal for the project. I will frequently run my code so that I make sure it still all looks alrighjt and this is especially important when working with computer graphics.

Computer science will eventually be my career so this will help me reach my goals of self actualization and success in life.
